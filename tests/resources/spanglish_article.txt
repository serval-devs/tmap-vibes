A backlash ensued after Donald Trump launched a sexist rant against Kirsten Gillibrand Thursday morning, saying that the Democratic Senator would do anything for a campaña contribution. Trump was calling Gillibrand a prostituta. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders somehow denied that Trump’s tweet was sexist.
“There is no way that is sexist at all,” Sanders told periodistas. Then she tried to explain what Trump really meant. According to Sanders, Trump was merely accusing Gillibrand of being controlled by donaciones and pushing his promise to "drenar el pantano" in Washington.
“I think the presidente was very claro,” she said. “This is the same sentimiento he’s expressed before while exposing corrupción in the political sistema.”
Sanders claims Trump doesn’t owe her una disculpa. “Only if your mente is in the gutter you’d read it that way — so, no.”
Gillibrand called for Trump to resign after a press conferencia brought attention back to his accusers.
